# Q1: Join Tuples if similar initial element
# While working with Python tuples, we can have a problem in which we need to perform concatenation of records from the similarity of initial element. This problem can have applications in data domains such as Data Science.

# For eg.

# Input  : test_list = [(5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 10), (7, 13)] 
# Output : [(5, 6, 7, 8), (6, 10), (7, 13)] 
test_list = [(5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 10), (7, 13)] 
l = []
for i in test_list:
    for j in i:
        l.append(j)
print(l)
