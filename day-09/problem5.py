# Problem 5: You are given a list of integers. You are asked to make a list by running through elements of the list by adding all elements greater and itself.
# i.e. Say given list is [2,4,6,10,1] resultant list will be [22,20,10,23].

# For 1st element 2 ->> these are greater (4+6+10) values and 2 itself so on adding becomes 22.

# For 2nd element 4 ->> greater elements are (6, 10) and 4 itself, so on adding 20

# like wise for all other elememts.

# [2,4,6,10,1]-->[22,20,16,10,23]

list1 = [2,4,6,10,1]
l = []

for i in range(0,len(list1)):
    sum = 0
    for j in range(0,len(list1)):
      
        if list1[i]<=list1[j]:
            sum+=list1[j]
    l.append(sum)
print(l)
